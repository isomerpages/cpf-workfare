> “With the extra cash that I get from Workfare, I usually use it for my daily expenses. I can also look forward to higher CPF payouts when I retire.”

*   As a mother to four children, Madam Huon Siew Chuo, 50, spent most of her adult life raising her children.
  
*   Realising that her children had grown up and she had more time to herself, Madam Huon decided to re-join the workforce to supplement her family’s income. **Workfare** tops up her income and encourages her to stay employed.
  
*   As a warehouse assistant, Madam Huon ensures that orders are correctly picked up and delivered.

*   On top of her monthly salary, Madam Huon receives Workfare payouts in **CPF top-ups** and **cash** from the Government. She looks forward to the monthly SMS notifications as she can use the additional cash to offset her daily expenses such as by topping up her EZ-Link card.
  
*   The Workfare CPF top-ups also enable Madam Huon to look forward to higher payouts when she eventually retires.
  
*   While the job can be physically taxing, Madam Huon maintains a positive attitude and shows no signs of slowing down. She actively keeps a look out for training courses so that she can upgrade her skills and earn a higher income through enlarged responsibilities.
