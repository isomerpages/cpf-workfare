notification: "If you are an employee, you do not need to do anything. Your
  eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will be automatically
  assessed based on the CPF contributions* made by your employer.   If you are a
  Self-Employed Person (SEP), you need to declare your net trade income (NTI)
  and contribute to your MediSave Account to be considered for WIS. Use our
  online WIS calculator to find out the amount you need to contribute to your
  MediSave Account.  You can declare your income and contribute to your MediSave
  Account in various ways.  To receive your WIS payouts by 30 April (via your
  PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or bank crediting), please declare your NTI
  and contribute to your MediSave Account by the last Friday of March.  *Under
  the CPF Act, employers must contribute to CPF if their employees earn more
  than $50 a month, regardless of whether the employee is employed on a
  permanent, part-time, contract or casual basis. If your employer is not
  contributing CPF on your behalf, you can lodge a report on non/underpayment of
  CPF contributions online. Please log in to my cpf with your Singpass, then
  select My Request > Other CPF Matters > Report on non-payment or underpayment
  of CPF contributions.  Alternatively, you can also lodge a report by calling
  the WorkRight Hotline at 1800-221-9922 or emailing to workright@mom.gov.sg.
  Your identity will be kept confidential.  "
