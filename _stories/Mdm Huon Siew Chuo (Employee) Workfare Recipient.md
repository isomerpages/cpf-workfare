* On top of her monthly salary, Madam Huon receives Workfare payouts in **CPF top-ups** and **cash** from the Government. She looks forward to the monthly SMS notifications as she can use the additional cash to offset her daily expenses such as by topping up her EZ-Link card.
* The Workfare CPF top-ups also enable Madam Huon to look forward to higher payouts when she eventually retires.
* While the job can be physically taxing, Madam Huon maintains a positive attitude and shows no signs of slowing down. She actively keeps a look out for training courses so that she can upgrade her skills and earn a higher income through enlarged responsibilities.
