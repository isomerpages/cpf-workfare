> “It’s nice to get the extra money from Workfare every year. It’s like a bonus for self-employed people like me. I use them for my daily expenses or pay the bills.”

* Mr Sutharalingam has been a taxi driver for the past 19 years. The 62-year-old enjoys his job as one of the perks of being a taxi driver is knowing where to go for delicious food.
* As a self-employed Singaporean, Mr Sutharalingam is eligible for **Workfare** which gives him an annual payout. After declaring his annual income and making contribution to his MediSave account, Mr Sutharalingam receives a **Workfare cash payout**.
Another 90 per cent of Workfare payout goes to his **CPF MediSave** account to help self-employed workers like him with medical needs.
* Mr Sutharalingam uses the Workfare cash payout on living expenses such as paying his bills or buying daily necessities.
* “I’m very happy with the Workfare payment. It’s good enough as it helps us a lot, especially seniors who are not earning a lot of money. The payout in MediSave will also be useful when I need to withdraw the money for my medical bills,” says Mr Sutharalingam.
* Mr Sutharalingam hopes to continue driving for another four to five years before switching to relief driving where he can work less hours. Although being a taxi driver can be stressful, especially when it comes to ferrying difficult passengers, he always takes it in his stride.
