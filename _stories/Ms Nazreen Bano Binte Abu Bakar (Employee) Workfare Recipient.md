* As a single mother to three children, Ms Nazreen Bano Bte Abu Bakar never gave up, no matter how difficult the situation was.
* After being away from the workforce for over a decade to bring up her children, Ms Nazreen decided to start working again. Workfare supported and encouraged her in this journey.
* 49-year-old Ms Nazreen works as a sales coordinator. She leads a team of seven at islandwide roadshows to promote open electricity market products.
* Ms Nazreen receives Workfare payouts in cash and CPF top-ups. She looks forward to receiving the SMS notifications informing her of Workfare payouts every month. These payouts help to offset family expenses.
* Ms Nazreen is currently staying in a rental flat with her three children. She is confident that the Workfare CPF top-ups will come in useful when she buys a HDB flat.
* She hopes to accumulate more CPF savings through her work contributions and Workfare so that she can enjoy higher monthly retirement payouts when she eventually stops work.
