> “It’s nice to get the extra money from Workfare every year. It’s like a bonus for self-employed people like me. I use them for my daily expenses or pay the bills.”

<br>

*   Mr Sutharalingam has been a taxi driver for the past 19 years. The 62-year-old enjoys his job as one of the perks of being a taxi driver is knowing where to go for delicious food.
  
*   As a self-employed Singaporean, Mr Sutharalingam is eligible for **Workfare** which gives him an annual payment. After declaring his annual income and making contribution to his MediSave account, Mr Sutharalingam receives a **Workfare cash payment.**
  
*   Another 90 per cent of Workfare payment goes to his **CPF MediSave** account to help self-employed workers like him with medical needs.
  
*   Mr Sutharalingam uses the Workfare cash payment on living expenses such as paying his bills or buying daily necessities.
  
*   “I’m very happy with the Workfare payment. It’s good enough as it helps us a lot, especially seniors who are not earning a lot of money. The payment in MediSave will also be useful when I need to withdraw the money for my medical bills,” says Mr Sutharalingam.
  
*   Mr Sutharalingam hopes to continue driving for another four to five years before switching to relief driving where he can work less hours. Although being a taxi driver can be stressful, especially when it comes to ferrying difficult passengers, he always takes it in his stride.

*   Mr Sutharalingam looks forward to receiving additional **MediSave top-ups**, more **subsidies at CHAS** clinics and additional subsidies for **MediShield Life**.
  
*   He also receives other help and support from the government, such as the **U-Save rebate** and **GST vouchers** which help to lessen his financial burden.

> “If my passengers are happy to talk to me, I will chat with them. But even if passengers become difficult, I will just keep quiet and not get angry. Why spoil your day for just one passenger when you still have to carry on working for the rest of the day?"
