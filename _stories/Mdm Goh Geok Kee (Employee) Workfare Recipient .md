* Mdm Goh Geok Kee (“Auntie Geok”) is one beneficiary of Workfare. 64-year-old this year, Auntie Geok has been working as a cleaner at MOM Service Centre at Bendemeer for the past seven years.

* Both Auntie Geok and her husband receive **Workfare** for working. From 2020, Workfare enhancements will boost her income by about 25%.

* As long as she remains fit and healthy, Auntie Geok would like to continue working. Many of her fellow co-workers also receive Workfare.

* Auntie Geok and her husband have a 24-year-old son who is currently a second-year Science student at NUS. Her son receives **CDC/CCC bursaries** annually to supplement the school fees and other costs of staying on campus.

* She owns the three-room flat she lives in with her husband and son.

* Her household also receives **GSTV-Cash** and **U-Save rebates** to offset their daily household expenses. Many other Workfare recipients (over 90%) similarly benefit from GSTV-Cash and U-Save rebates.

* Auntie Geok, her husband, and her son, each has the **CHAS Blue car**d. They receive highly subsidised medical and dental services at CHAS clinics.

* She is amongst the 4 in 10 Workfare recipients in 2017 who also receive medical and dental subsidies under the CHAS scheme.

* Auntie Geok is grateful that Workfare and Government’s subsidies for older workers like her amount to significant support for her and her family. In her own words, “这边一点，那边一点, 加起来其实很多!” [Translated: here a bit, there a bit, Government support actually add up a lot].
