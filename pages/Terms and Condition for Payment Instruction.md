1. You consent to the Government sharing your NRIC number and bank account information with other public sector agencies (including statutory boards) and authorised agents of the Government (collectively, the “Paying Agencies”), unless such sharing is prohibited by law.

2. You consent to the Government and the Paying Agencies using your NRIC number and bank account information for any cash payments from the Government (including but not limited to GST Voucher, Silver Support, Workfare and CPF schemes) that you may be eligible for.

3. You consent to the Government confirming/verifying information about you and your account ("Account") as stated in this application with the bank ("Bank") where the Account is maintained.

4. You irrevocably consent to the Bank (including any officer thereof) to disclose any information whatsoever relating to you and the Account as is necessary, for the purpose of validating the Account.

5. You agree that this consent will survive the termination of the Account with the Bank and may be relied on and enforced as fully and effectively by the Bank as if it is addressed to the Bank.

6. You understand that the Government has the discretion to decide whether or not to perform such verification. You will not hold the Government responsible if it does not perform such verification.

7. You understand that if the scheme has PayNow-NRIC as a payment mode, your cash payments from the Government will be credited to your PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account. Otherwise, payment will be made to you based on the bank account information as stated in this application.

8. You understand that the Government may, by notice, change these terms and conditions from time to time by posting the new terms and conditions on the relevant scheme's website. Unless indicated otherwise, the changes will apply to you and will be effective as of the date the changes are posted on the website. You are advised to check the relevant scheme's website regularly. The Government may also choose to inform you by other means of communication. Your continued eligibility/participation in the relevant scheme or the use of the relevant services constitutes acceptance of the new terms and conditions.
9. You understand that by submitting this application, you will sign up for the respective scheme, if applicable.

10. You shall hereafter indemnify the Government and the Paying Agencies, and hold them harmless from and against all actions, proceedings, claims, liabilities, penalties, awards, damages, costs (including without limitation, legal costs of the Government and the Paying Agencies, on a solicitor and own client basis), expenses and any loss whatsoever, however arising, directly or indirectly, which the Government and the Paying Agencies may be liable to incur or suffer as a result of disbursing any cash payments from the Government into the bank account as stated in this application.
