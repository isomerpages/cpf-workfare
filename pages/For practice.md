# How can I tell if the Workfare SMS I received is authentic?

With the recent rise in scam and phishing attempts, it is important to verify that the message received is genuine from the official source.

Please note that with effect from 1 August 2022, we have changed our SMS sender ID from “SG-Workfare” to “CPF Board”. We will no longer send SMS notifications on Workfare using “SG-Workfare”.

This is only an example of a Workfare SMS. The actual SMS received may be different.

Hence, always remember:

*   The SMS will always be sent by **‘CPF Board’** to the **mobile number registered with CPF Board** and your masked NRIC (showing the last 3 numerals and letter, e.g. SXXXX123A) will be in the SMS. We will not send SMS from other IDs.
*   We will only inform citizens of their benefits via letter and SMS. We do not use WhatsApp or other mobile app messaging platforms.
*   We will never request for you to reply to the SMS nor direct you to a non-Government site. If the SMS contains an URL, always check that the domain ends with ".gov.sg". When in doubt, search for the organization website directly using search engines to ensure that the link is legitimate.
*   Ensure that the SMS meets all of the checks above before proceeding to click on the URL. After you have clicked through to the webpage, be extra vigilant before providing sensitive information such as your Singpass or bank account details. Look out for valid encryption certificates by checking for the lock in the browser's address bar:
