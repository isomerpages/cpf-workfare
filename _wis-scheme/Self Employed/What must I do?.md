### What must I do?

For work done in a year, you will receive WIS in the next year after you:
* declare your net trade income to: the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) if you have been issued an income tax return package; or the CPF Board if you have not been issued an income tax return package, by logging in to the CPF website with your Singpass to complete and submit the <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/IncomeDeclarationBySelfEmployedPersonForMedisaveLiability/LandingPage">Self-Employed Person Income Declaration Form</a> by 18 April. After 18 April, please <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/FeedbackSubscription/Index?utm_source=shortURL">write to us</a> for us to process your income declaration; and

* make the required MediSave contributions.
