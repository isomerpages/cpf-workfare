### What must I do?

For work done in a year, we will pay your WIS in the next year after you:
* declare your income to: IRAS if you have been issued an income tax return package; or CPFB at any Singapore Post branch if you have not been issued the income tax return package; and

* make the required MediSave contributions.

The earlier you declare your income and make MediSave contributions, the earlier you will receive your WIS payout.


Declare your income and make your MediSave contributions by last Friday of March to receive WIS by 30 April*.

*Payment via PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or bank crediting will be by the end of the month while payment via GovCash will be on the 3rd of the following month.

Use the online [WIS calculator](/wis-calculator-for-self-employed/) to find out the amount to contribute.
