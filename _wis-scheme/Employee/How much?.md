### How much?

### You will receive
40% of your WIS payment in cash, and 60% in CPF contributions. We will pay the cash portion into your bank account, or send you a cheque if you do not have a bank account. Click [here](https://www.workfare.gov.sg/app/Home/Index?returnUrl=/PaymentInstructions/Edit) to update your bank account.

Use the online [WIS calculator](https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Pages/Calculator.aspx) to see how much WIS you can receive.
