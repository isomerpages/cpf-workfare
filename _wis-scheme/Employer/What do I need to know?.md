### What do I need to know as an employer?

Under the CPF Act, employers must contribute CPF if their employees earn more than $50 per month, regardless of whether the employee is employed on a permanent, part-time, contract or casual basis.


We will automatically assess their eligibility for WIS based on the CPF contributions made.
