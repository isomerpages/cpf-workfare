### Benefits

As WIS encourages Singaporeans to work, you may find it easier to hire and retain locals.

The cost of Workfare is borne fully by the Government, with no risk of raising business costs for local enterprises or causing Singaporean workers to lose their jobs. Unlike a minimum wage, Workfare is not borne by employers.
