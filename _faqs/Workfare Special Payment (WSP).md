	<summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q1. What is the Workfare Special Payment?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Special Payment (WSP) was introduced in 2020 to provide additional support for older, lower-wage workers.<br><br>
All Singaporean employees and Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) who have received Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) pay-outs for work done in Work Year (WY) 2019 would have automatically received WSP in 2020.<br><br>
The WSP provides a total cash payout of $3,000 for all eligible Singaporeans. Eligible employees and SEPs will receive the same amount of $3,000, which will be paid over two equal payments of $1,500 each, in July and October 2020.<br><br>
<b>Extension of Workfare Special Payment</b><br><br>
As announced on 17 August 2020, the WSP will be extended to include lower-wage workers who (i) have received WIS pay-outs for work done in WY2020 and (ii) did not qualify for WSP previously.<br><br>
Newly eligible recipients will receive the full one-off WSP of $3,000 from October 2020 onwards automatically.<br><br></details>
<details>
<summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q2. How and when were the Workfare Special Payment payouts disbursed?</b></font></summary>
For Singaporeans who had received the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payouts for WY2019, the WSP payouts were paid over two equal payments of $1,500 each in July and October 2020* via direct bank crediting; and in August and November 2020 via cheque payment.<br><br>
For Singaporeans who had received the WIS payouts for WY2020, but not for WY2019, the WSP was paid in full in October 2020 via direct bank crediting and in November 2020 via cheque payment.<br><br>
	<u>Notes:</u><br>
* Singaporeans who qualify for WY2019 WIS after July 2020 but before 31 March 2021 will receive the WSP in the month that they become eligible for WY2019 WIS<br>
^ Singaporeans who qualify for WY2020 WIS after October 2020 but before 31 December 2021 will receive the WSP in the month that they become eligible for WY2020 WIS<br><br>
	<u>Mode of Payment:</u><br><br>
The WSP will be given to eligible Singaporeans in the same way as their WIS payments – direct crediting to their bank account, or cheque sent to their NRIC address for those who do not have a bank account registered for cash payments from the Government. Payments by cheque take up to 2 weeks longer compared to bank crediting.<br><br>
From March 2022 onwards, the payout will be credited in their PayNow NRIC-linked bank account if they have one.<br><br>
Otherwise, it will be credited to the DBS/POSB, OCBC or UOB bank account that they have registered to receive Government payouts (e.g. either the GST-Voucher (GSTV), Silver Support Scheme (SSS) or WIS, whichever is latest) or credited to GovCash if they had not registered a bank account with us.<br><br>
Electronic payments make transactions simple, swift, and safe for recipients. WIS recipients are encouraged to link their NRIC number to their bank account or <a href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/App/Home/Index?returnUrl=/paymentinstructions/edit" class="hyperlink">update</a> their bank account to receive their payments earlier*.<br><br>
* If the NRIC number was linked to the recipient's bank account after 16th of the month or the bank account details were submitted after 14th of the month, the updates will only be effective in the following month. 
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q3. Why are there differences in the eligibility cut-off dates between Workfare Special Payment and Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
To receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for work done in Work Year (WY) 2019 and WY 2020, you must qualify for WIS by 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 respectively.<br><br>
The Workfare Special Payment (WSP) is intended to be a one-off payment to Singaporean lower-wage workers to provide additional help in 2020, given the extraordinary economic uncertainty.<br><br>
For both WY2019 WIS and WY2020 WIS recipients, the WSP eligibility cut-off dates are set such that they are at least one year after the relevant Work Years.<ul>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Before 31 March 2021, for work done in 2019; or</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Before 31 December 2021, for work done in 2020.</li></ul>
This provides sufficient time for SEPs to declare their income and contribute to MediSave accordingly to qualify for WIS for the relevant Work Year, and hence WSP.<br><br>
For WY2019 WIS recipients, as the announcement of the WSP was after WY2019 (i.e. in March 2020), we have given slightly more time (one year after the announcement of the WSP at the Resilience Budget) for applicants to complete the required process to qualify for WY2019 WIS. It will also facilitate a more timely and efficient payment of WSP.<br><br>
For Employees<br><br>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">You are unlikely to be affected by the eligibility cut-off date because your WIS eligibility will be automatically assessed based on the CPF contributions made by your employer.</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Under the CPF Act, employers must contribute CPF if their employees earn more than $50 a month, regardless of whether the employee is employed on a permanent, part-time, contract or casual basis.<br><br>
If your employee is not contributing CPF on your behalf, you can lodge a report on non/underpayment of CPF contributions <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Services/MyRequest/MyRequestLanding" class="hyperlink">online</a>. Please log in to my CPF Online Services with your Singpass, then select My Requests &gt; Other CPF Matters &gt; Report on non-payment or underpayment of CPF contributions.</li></ul>
Alternatively, you can also lodge a report by calling the WorkRight Hotline at 1800-221-9922 or emailing to <a href="workright@mom.gov.sg" class="hyperlink">workright@mom.gov.sg</a>. All calls will be kept confidential.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q4. I have other queries on the Workfare Special Payment (WSP). Who can I ask?</b></font></summary>
You may visit <a href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/" class="hyperlink">workfare.gov.sg</a> for more information on the Workfare scheme.<br><br>
For enquires on the Workfare Special Payment (WSP), you may email us at <a href="workfare@govtopup.gov.sg" class="hyperlink">workfare@govtopup.gov.sg</a>.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q5. How do I qualify for Workfare Special Payment as a Self-Employed Person?</b></font></summary>
To receive the Workfare Special Payment (WSP) as a Self-Employed Person, you must first qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) by the following deadlines:
<ul>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Before 31 March 2021, for work done in 2019; or</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Before 31 December 2021, for work done in 2020.</li></ul>
To qualify for WIS, you need to declare your income, and make the required MediSave contributions. Use our online WIS calculator to find out the amount you need to contribute to your MediSave Account.<br><br>
If you meet the eligibility criteria, you will receive your WIS and WSP payouts at the end of the month following your qualification.<br><br>
<u>For Work Year (WY) 2019 WIS recipients who did not receive the first WSP payout in July 2020</u><br><br>
You should have received the first WSP of $1,500 in the same month as your WY2019 WIS payout and the second WSP of $1,500 in October 2020.<br><br>
If you only receive your WY2019 WIS payout in/after October 2020, you will receive the full WSP of $3,000 in the same month as your WY2019 WIS payout. <br><br>
<u>For WY2020 WIS recipients</u><br><br>
You should have received the WSP payout of $3,000 in October 2020. If you only receive your WY2020 WIS payouts after October 2020, you will receive your WSP payout of $3,000 in the same month as your WY2020 WIS payout.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q6. Who is eligible for Workfare Special Payment?</b></font></summary>
You will be eligible for the Workfare Special Payment (WSP) if you qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)<sup>1</sup> for
<ul>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Work Year (WY) 2019 before 31 March 2021; or</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px">Work Year (WY) 2020 before 31 December 2021 and were previously not eligible for WSP.</li></ul>
Workers aged 35 and below with disabilities and are eligible for WIS will also be eligible for WSP.<br><br>
	<sup>1</sup> Employees would be eligible for WSP if they receive WIS at least once for the work done in the Work Year i.e. 2019 or 2020, whichever is applicable.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q7. Can I use another bank account other than the 3 local banks for the payment of my Workfare Special Payment?</b></font></summary>
You can receive payouts in a bank account other than DBS/POSB, OCBC or UOB if your bank account has been set up with PayNow and is linked to your NRIC number.<br><br>
If you do not have a PayNow NRIC-linked bank account, you may follow the steps below to create one:
<ol>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Set up internet / mobile banking with your bank</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Log in to your bank's internet / mobile banking application</li>
		<li style="font-size:15.5px">Link your NRIC number to your bank account at the PayNow registration screen</li></ol>
You may also refer to your bank's website for specific details to do so. If you do not have Internet or mobile banking, you can contact your bank directly to register for PayNow.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q8. Why was Workfare Special Payment extended to Work Year (WY) 2020 Workfare Income Supplement recipients?</b></font></summary>
Many individuals are experiencing significant uncertainty over their jobs and their livelihoods during this time.<br><br>
The extension of Workfare Special Payment to include Work Year (WY) 2020 Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) recipients will help those who become lower-wage workers more recently (i.e. newly qualified for WIS for work done in 2020). <br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q9. I have already qualified for Workfare Special Payment (WSP) and received my first payment of $1,500 in Jul 2020, am I affected by the extension of WSP?</b></font></summary>
The extension of Workfare Special Payment (WSP) will not affect you if you have already qualified for WSP and received your first payment of $1,500 in Jul 2020.<br><br>
You will receive the final tranche of $1,500 in October 2020.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q10. I am eligible for both Work Year (WY) 2019 WIS and Work Year (WY) 2020 Workfare Income Supplement. Why am I not eligible to receive another $3,000 for Workfare Special Payment?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Special Payment (WSP) was extended to include lower-wage workers who (i) have received Workfare Income Supplement payouts for work done in Work Year 2020 and (ii) did not qualify for WSP previously.<br><br>
It is not an additional payment for those who have earlier qualified for WSP.<br><br>
Each eligible individual can only receive the $3,000 WSP once.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q11. Will I receive Workfare Special Payment if I am unemployed?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme supplements the income and CPF savings of lower-wage Singaporeans when they work, to encourage them to enter and remain in the workforce.<br><br>
As recipients of Workfare Special Payment (WSP) must first be eligible for WIS, you will not be eligible for WSP if you are unemployed.<br><br>
If you require assistance in looking for a job, or are seeking information on training and skills upgrading, please approach any of the Distributed CareerLink Networks run by the Community Development Councils (CDCs). Alternatively, you can call Workforce Singapore (WSG) hotline at 6883 5885.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q12. Why am I not able to receive my Workfare Special Payment payouts earlier?</b></font></summary>
Time is needed to plan for and implement smooth and accurate disbursements. This includes confirming the eligibility of the recipients of the Workfare Special Payment (WSP) payout, and testing of systems.<br><br>
Households that need more help in the interim can approach a Social Service Office for further information.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q13. My current GIRO instalment plan to pay my MediSave liabilities only ends after the cut-off date to receive Workfare Special Payment, what should I do?</b></font></summary>

<br><br></details>

Gross monthly income includes salary (before deduction of CPF contribution), bonuses, allowances and overtime pay received during the work period.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427" size="+1"><b>Q24. How do I link my NRIC to PayNow?</b></font></summary>
You may follow the steps below:<br>
<ol>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Set up internet / mobile banking with your bank</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Log in to your bank's internet / mobile banking application</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Link your NRIC number to your bank account at the PayNow registration screen</li></ol>
You may also refer to your bank's website for specific details to do so. If you do not have Internet or mobile banking, you can contact your bank directly to register for PayNow-NRIC. 
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427" size="+1"><b>
Q25. I have linked my PayNow bank account to my mobile number. Will I receive my Workfare payouts via PayNow?</b></font></summary>
We can only credit your Workfare payouts to you via your PayNow bank account if it is linked to your NRIC number. This is because the NRIC number is an unchanged proxy issued by the Government, unlike mobile numbers which can change. To ensure that the money is credited to the correct recipient's bank account, only NRIC will be accepted as the proxy for government payouts via PayNow.  
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q26. What is GovCash?</b></font></summary>
GovCash is a quicker and more convenient way for citizens to receive their payouts from Government agencies as compared to cheque. Singaporeans can withdraw the Government payments in cash from over 500 OCBC ATMs located across Singapore. GovCash is no less secure than receiving payouts via cheque. It has adopted the Singpass facial verification technology to authenticate users, including a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos or masks during the verification process. Singaporeans do not need to have an OCBC bank account to use the GovCash service.<br><br> 
Previously, cheque recipients would have to deposit the cheques or encash them over the bank counters. GovCash allows them to receive their payouts at the ATM immediately at any time of the day. They are no longer restricted by the bank’s operating hours. Singaporeans who prefer to seek assistance with their GovCash withdrawals can visit the ATMs located within OCBC’s branches during operating hours, where OCBC Digital Ambassadors will be present to guide them.<br><br>
In addition, GovCash also allows recipients to use the scan-and-pay function and PayNow transfer option through the LifeSG mobile app.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>Q27. How can I utilise my GovCash?
</b></font></summary>
You can withdraw your payouts in cash at the listed OCBC ATMs with GovCash functions with your 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN), which will be sent to you by SMS or by post. You do not need to have a OCBC bank account to use this service.<br><br>
You can also transfer your payouts to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or utilise them to make payments at any merchants or transfer to your friends by scanning their PayNow QR code using the LifeSG mobile app. You can download the LifeSG mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.<br><br>
You may refer to the <a href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Documents/Leaflet_GovCash.pdf" class="hyperlink">step-by-step guide</a> for detailed instructions on the ways you can utilise your GovCash payouts. 
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>
Q28. Where can I obtain my Payment Reference Number (PRN)?
</b></font></summary>
Your PRN can be found in your Workfare notification from the Board. Alternatively, visit workfare.gov.sg, login with your Singpass and select “View my Payment Reference Number (PRN)”.
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font size="+1" color="#009427"><b>
Q29. How do I check my GovCash balance?</b></font></summary>
To check your GovCash balance, please visit any OCBC ATMs with GovCash functions</a> with your 8-digit Payment Reference Number* (PRN). Upon successful authentication, you will be able to view your GovCash balance.<br><br>
Alternatively, you may login to the LifeSG mobile app using your Singpass to view your GovCash balance and transaction history. You may refer to the <a href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Documents/Leaflet_GovCash.pdf" class="hyperlink">step-by-step guide</a> for detailed instructions.<br><br>
*Your PRN can be found in your Workfare notification from the CPF Board, and at the <a href="https://workfare.gov.sg/app/ePRN/Index" class="hyperlink">Workfare Portal</a> (Singpass login is required).

Q31. What should I do if I do not want to receive my payouts via GovCash?</b></font></summary>
You can choose to receive your payouts via PayNow NRIC-linked bank account by linking your NRIC number to your PayNow bank account.<br><br>
To link your NRIC number to your bank account, you may follow the steps below:<br>
<ol>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Set up internet / mobile banking with your bank</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Log in to your bank's internet / mobile banking application</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">Link your NRIC number to your bank account at the PayNow registration screen</li></ol>
You may also refer to your bank's website for specific details to do so. If you do not have Internet or mobile banking, you can contact your bank directly to register for PayNow-NRIC.<br><br>
Otherwise, you can choose to receive your payouts via Direct Bank Crediting. To do so, simply visit here, login with your Singpass, select "<a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/app/Account/QRLogin?returnUrl=/PaymentInstructions/Edit">View / Update Payment Mode</a>" and update your POSB/DBS, OCBC or UOB bank account details.

Q32. Why can withdrawals be made only in $10 denominations and what can I do with my balance GovCash?</b></font></summary>
Currently, the minimum withdrawal amount at the ATMs is $10. Hence, GovCash withdrawals can also be made in $10 denominations. If the balance in your GovCash is less than $10, you can accumulate your balance monies before your next withdrawal.<br><br>
Alternatively, you can also transfer the balance to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or utilise them to make payments at any merchants or transfer to your friends by scanning the PayNow QR code using the LifeSG mobile app. You may refer to the <a href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Documents/Leaflet_GovCash.pdf" class="hyperlink">step-by-step guide</a> for detailed instructions.
