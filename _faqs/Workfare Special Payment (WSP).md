		<summary>Q1. What is the Workfare Special Payment?</summary>
The Workfare Special Payment (WSP) was introduced in 2020 to provide additional support for older, lower-wage workers.<br><br>
All Singaporean employees and Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) who have received Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) pay-outs for work done in Work Year (WY) 2019 would have automatically received WSP in 2020.<br><br>
The WSP provides a total cash payout of $3,000 for all eligible Singaporeans. Eligible employees and SEPs will receive the same amount of $3,000, which will be paid over two equal payments of $1,500 each, in July and October 2020.<br><br>
<b>Extension of Workfare Special Payment</b><br><br>
As announced on 17 August 2020, the WSP will be extended to include lower-wage workers who (i) have received WIS pay-outs for work done in WY2020 and (ii) did not qualify for WSP previously.<br><br>
Newly eligible recipients will receive the full one-off WSP of $3,000 from October 2020 onwards automatically.<br><br></details>
