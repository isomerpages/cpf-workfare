<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. I am earning close to $2,300, why are my Workfare Income Supplement payouts so low?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more.<br><br>
To best support lower wage workers, the WIS benefits are gradually reduced as the income levels of the workers increase nearer to the qualifying amount of $2,300. The gradual reduction ensures that the lower-wage workers do not see a sharp reduction in their WIS benefits when they upgrade their skills and begin to earn more. Taken together, the total amount of the income and the WIS payouts would still increase overall as one's income increases<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. I am earning $50 or less per month. What do I need to do to receive the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
You will be eligible for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if you meet all the other eligibility criteria and make voluntary CPF contributions for the monthly wages (where CPF contribution is exempted).<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. I am a contract / part-time employee. Will I be eligible for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
Contract / part-time employees are eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if they meet the WIS eligibility criteria.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. I am on no-pay/study/medical/maternity leave. Will I be considered as employed to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
For the purposes of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), staff on study/medical/maternity leave will be considered as employees if you are still receiving a salary and CPF contributions from your employers.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q6. Of the Workfare Income Supplement payment to my CPF, what is the proportion credited into the various CPF accounts?</b></font></summary>
Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is paid partially in cash to help you with your immediate expenditure, and partially into your CPF accounts to boost your retirement adequacy. Up to age 55, a higher proportion is credited into your Special and MediSave Accounts to boost your retirement and healthcare savings respectively. After age 55, similar to employees, the majority of the contributions will go towards MediSave, with smaller proportions going towards the other two accounts.<br><br>
You can refer to the table below on the proportion of the WIS CPF payout credited into the three accounts, according to the age bands.<br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q7. How is my income calculated for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
We will calculate your income based on the CPF contributions made by your employer(s) for work done in that month.<br><br></details></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Why do Self-Employed Persons receive only two-thirds of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) received by employees?</b></font></summary>
The CPF contribution made by Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) is comparatively lesser than employees who earn the same amount. SEPs are only required to contribute to their MediSave Account whereas employees need to contribute to all their CPF Accounts (Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts)<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why do employees receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments while Self-Employed Persons receive their WIS once a year?</b></font></summary>
The incomes of employees are automatically computed based on their monthly CPF contributions from their employers. This enables CPF Board to assess their Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility automatically and disburse their WIS payouts on a monthly basis.<br><br>
On the other hand, the net trade income (NTI) of a Self-Employed Person (SEP) is assessed over an entire year and can only be determined the following year after the current year has ended.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. Who is a Self-Employed person (SEP)?</b></font></summary>
A Self-Employed Person (SEP) is any individual who derives income from Singapore or from outside Singapore through any trade, business, profession or vocation excluding employment under a contract of service.<br><br>
If you earn an income by buying and selling goods or providing professional or personal services, you are a SEP. Examples of Self-Employed Persons include hawkers, taxi drivers, freelancers, sole proprietors or a partner in a partnership.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Why must Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) contribute to MediSave to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
A key principle of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is that each recipient has a personal responsibility to save for his future needs, with the Government providing additional support.<br><br>
Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as they do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers. It is important to contribute regularly to ensure enough savings for healthcare needs. This is especially important during old age, when SEPs may have stopped working.<br><br>
WIS is intended to supplement, not replace the MediSave contributions made by the SEPs.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. What are the payment modes for making MediSave contributions?</b></font></summary>
There are several ways you can make your MediSave contributions.<br><br>
The most convenient way is via GIRO, which allows automatic monthly deductions from your bank account. You may apply to pay via GIRO online (if you have a bank account from OCBS/DBS/POSB) or by mail (for other banks).<br><br>
The payment options are:
