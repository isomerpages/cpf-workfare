		<summary><b><font color="#009427">What are the enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme?</font></b></summary>The Government will enhance Workfare from Work Year 2023:<ol class="loweraplh">
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Qualifying monthly income cap raised from $2,300 to $2,500</b><sup>1</sup>. This takes into account income growth of Singaporeans.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Extension of Workfare to those aged 30 - 34</b>. The payouts will help them better cope with their expenses and to start saving early for their retirement.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Higher annual Workfare payouts of up to $4,200</b>. Payouts depend on age and income, and have been enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees can receive up to $4,200 per year in payouts, compared to $4,000 per year today. Older workers will continue to receive the highest payouts. The payouts for self-employed persons are set at two-thirds of employee payouts and will be correspondingly increased.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>All persons with disabilities (PWDs) will qualify for the highest Workfare payout tier (up to $4,200), regardless of age.</b></li>

<li style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b><font color="#009427">Why will Workfare enhancements only take place in 2023?</font></b></summary>
Implementing the Workfare enhancements in 2023 provides sufficient time to make the required system changes, for smooth implementation of the enhancements.<br><br>
The current Workfare criteria, which only came into effect two years ago in 2020, will continue to apply for work done in 2022.<br><br></details></li>
<li style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b><font color="#009427">What is the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</font></b></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details></li>

		<summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. What are the enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme?</b></font></summary>
The Government will enhance Workfare from Work Year 2023:
<ol class="loweraplh">
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Qualifying monthly income cap raised from $2,300 to $2,500</b><sup>1</sup>. This takes into account income growth of Singaporeans.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Extension of Workfare to those aged 30 - 34</b>. The payouts will help them better cope with their expenses and to start saving early for their retirement.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Higher annual Workfare payouts of up to $4,200</b>. Payouts depend on age and income, and have been enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees can receive up to $4,200 per year in payouts, compared to $4,000 per year today. Older workers will continue to receive the highest payouts. The payouts for self-employed persons are set at two-thirds of employee payouts and will be correspondingly increased.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>All persons with disabilities (PWDs) will qualify for the highest Workfare payout tier (up to $4,200), regardless of age.</b></li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Minimum qualifying monthly income criterion of $500</b>. To encourage regular employment, Singaporean workers will need to earn at least $500 per month to qualify for Workfare.</li></ol><br><sup>1</sup> In addition, one must earn an average gross monthly income of not more than $2,500 in the past 12 months.<br><br></details>
	<details>
		<summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why will Workfare enhancements only take place in 2023?</b></font></summary>
Implementing the Workfare enhancements in 2023 provides sufficient time to make the required system changes, for smooth implementation of the enhancements.<br><br>
The current Workfare criteria, which only came into effect two years ago in 2020, will continue to apply for work done in 2022<br><br></details>
	<details>
		<summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. What is the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details>
	<details>
		<summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Am I eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</b></font></summary>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q19. Are inmates eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?
</b></font></summary>
Inmates who have worked while serving their sentences may be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme as Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) by making voluntary MediSave contributions based on the income earned during incarceration. The Singapore Prison Service will furnish inmates' work records to the Board in the following year and inmatesโ family members may make the MediSave contributions to the Board on behalf of the inmates.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q20. How much cash and CPF top-ups will I receive from the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?
</b></font></summary>
If you are an employee, you will receive 60% of your Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payout in CPF contributions and the remaining 40% in cash.<br><br>
A higher proportion is credited into your Special and MediSave Accounts to boost your retirement and healthcare savings, as savings in these accounts earn up to 5% per annum if you are below 55, and up to 6% per annum if you are 55 or above.<br><br>
You can refer to the table below on the allocation of the WIS CPF payout into the three accounts, according to the age bands.<br>

Q21. How will I receive the cash portion of my Workfare Income Supplement payouts?</b></font></summary>
The cash portion of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will be credited to your bank account that you have registered to receive Government payouts (e.g. either the GST-Voucher (GSTV), Silver Support Scheme (SSS) or WIS, whichever is latest) or sent to you via cheque if you do not have a bank account.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. My employer does not pay my CPF. What can I do to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
Under the CPF Act, employers must contribute CPF if their employees earn more than $50 a month, regardless of whether the employee is employed on a permanent, part-time, contract or casual basis.<br><br>
If your employer is not contributing CPF on your behalf, you can lodge a report on non/underpayment of CPF contributions online.

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. I am earning close to $2,300, why are my Workfare Income Supplement payouts so low?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more.<br><br>
To best support lower wage workers, the WIS benefits are gradually reduced as the income levels of the workers increase nearer to the qualifying amount of $2,300. The gradual reduction ensures that the lower-wage workers do not see a sharp reduction in their WIS benefits when they upgrade their skills and begin to earn more. Taken together, the total amount of the income and the WIS payouts would still increase overall as one's income increases.<br><br>
As announced at Budget 2022, WIS will be enhanced from Work Year 2023. Click <a class="hyperlink" href="/files/pdf-press-release/Feb%202022/Enhanced%20Workfare%20Income%20Supplement%20Scheme%20From%20Work%20Year%202023.pdf">here</a> to find out more about the upcoming WIS enhancements.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. I am on no-pay/study/medical/maternity leave. Will I be considered as employed to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
For the purposes of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), staff on study/medical/maternity leave will be considered as employees if you are still receiving a salary and CPF contributions from your employers.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q6. Of the Workfare Income Supplement payment to my CPF, what is the proportion credited into the various CPF accounts?</b></font></summary>
Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is paid partially in cash to help you with your immediate expenditure, and partially into your CPF accounts to boost your retirement adequacy. Up to age 55, a higher proportion is credited into your Special and MediSave Accounts to boost your retirement and healthcare savings respectively. After age 55, similar to employees, the majority of the contributions will go towards MediSave, with smaller proportions going towards the other two accounts.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Who is a Self-Employed person (SEP)?</b></font></summary>
A Self-Employed Person (SEP) is any individual who derives income from Singapore or from outside Singapore through any trade, business, profession or vocation excluding employment under a contract of service.<br><br>
If you earn an income by buying and selling goods or providing professional or personal services, you are a SEP. Examples of Self-Employed Persons include hawkers, taxi drivers, freelancers, sole proprietors or a partner in a partnership.<br><br>
Visit the <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Businesses/Self-Employed/Learning-the-basics/Am-I-an-Employee-or-a-Self-Employed/" class="hyperlink">Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website</a> to read more on the definition of a SEP.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why do Self-Employed Persons receive only two-thirds of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) received by employees?</b></font></summary>
The CPF contribution made by Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) is comparatively lesser than employees who earn the same amount. SEPs are only required to contribute to their MediSave Account whereas employees need to contribute to all their CPF Accounts (Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts).<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. Why do employees receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments while Self-Employed Persons receive their WIS once a year?</b></font></summary>
The incomes of employees are automatically computed based on their monthly CPF contributions from their employers. This enables CPF Board to assess their Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility automatically and disburse their WIS payouts on a monthly basis.<br><br>
On the other hand, the net trade income (NTI) of a Self-Employed Person (SEP) is assessed over an entire year and can only be determined the following year after the current year has ended.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Why must Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) contribute to MediSave to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
A key principle of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is that each recipient has a personal responsibility to save for his future needs, with the Government providing additional support.<br><br>
Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as they do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers. It is important to contribute regularly to ensure enough savings for healthcare needs. This is especially important during old age, when SEPs may have stopped working.<br><br>
WIS is intended to supplement, not replace the MediSave contributions made by the SEPs.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. What are the payment modes for making MediSave contributions?</b></font></summary>
There are several ways you can make your MediSave contributions.<br><br>
The most convenient way is via GIRO, which allows automatic monthly deductions from your bank account. You may apply to pay via GIRO online (if you have a bank account from OCBC/DBS/POSB) or by mail (for other banks).<br><br>

The objective of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is to supplement the retirement savings and incomes of older and lower-wage Singaporeans, and to encourage them to work regularly.<br><br>
A person may be eligible for WIS if he is engaged in work that draws an income.<br><br>
Allowances received for carrying out family support roles such as babysitting and caregiving for dependents are considered transfers within the family. They are not external sources of income derived from employment, hence it would not be appropriate to consider these transfers for WIS.<br><br>
The Government recognizes that such family roles are important. There are other forms of government support for these roles, such as the Marriage and Parenthood package which provides broad-based support for couples to raise and care for their children.<br><br></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. To qualify for Workfare Income Supplement, what is considered income?</b></font></summary>
Employee income is based on the definition of Gross Wages under the CPF Act:<br><br>
Total Gross Wages = Total Ordinary Wages + Total Additional Wages<br><br>
Where:<br>
Ordinary Wages are wages due or granted wholly and exclusively in respect of an employee's employment in that month and payable before the due date for payment of CPF contributions for that month.<br><br>
Additional Wages are wages which are not granted wholly and exclusively for that month. Examples are annual bonus, leave pay and other payments made at intervals of more than a month.<br><br>
Total Wages are the total amount of an employee's wages for any calendar month, which is the sum of his Ordinary Wages for the month and the Additional Wages paid to him in that month.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why are overtime pay and bonuses included in Workfare Income Supplement assessment?</b></font></summary>
Basic salary, overtime pay, and bonuses are part of a workerโs total income that will help support the worker and his or her family. Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining oneโs eligibility for WIS.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. How does the income criterion work?</b></font></summary>
To receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for work done in any month, employees must have earned:<br><br>
<ol>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px"> a gross monthly income of not more than $2,300* in that particular month; and</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px"> an average gross monthly income of not more than $2,300 in the past 12 months.</li></ol>
*From Work Year 2023, the qualifying income cap will be raised to $2,500.

</details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Why am I not eligible for Workfare Income Supplement or Workfare Special Payment despite my gross monthly income being less than $2,300 as an employee?</b></font></summary>
Gross monthly income includes salary (before deduction of CPF contribution), bonuses, allowances and overtime pay received during the work period.<br><br>
Other than gross monthly income, you must also earn an average gross monthly income of not more than $2,300* in the past 12 months.<br><br>
The average gross monthly income is defined as:<br><br>
<i>Sum of income earned in the past 12-month period รท Total number of months worked in the past 12-month period</i><br><br>

<details><summary style="border: 1px solid #4F4F4F;
	background: #4F4F4F;"><font size="+1.5" color="#FFF"><b>Eligibility Criteria - Housing</b></font></summary>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Do residents in welfare homes qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
Residents in welfare homes registered with the National Council of Social Service/ Ministry of Health/ Ministry of Social and Family Development will qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if they meet all of the other WIS eligibility criteria.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why is the Annual Value of my place of residence used to assess my eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value (AV) serves as a housing criterion that targets lower-wage workers from lower income households.<br><br>
Using AV instead of housing type is a fairer way to determine property value as some applicants may be staying in smaller and less expensive private properties with an AV similar to a larger Housing &amp; Development Board flat.<br><br>
</details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. What is the Annual Value of a property?</b></font></summary>
Annual Value (AV) is the estimated gross annual rent of the property if it were to be rented out, excluding furniture, furnishings and maintenance fees. It is determined based on estimated market rentals of similar or comparable properties. It can be found on the property tax bill you receive each year.<br><br>
For more information on the computation of AV, please visit the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Learning-the-basics/About-Annual-Value/">Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website</a>.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. How is the Annual Value (AV) requirement for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) decided?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value (AV) threshold of $13,000 covers all HDB flats, as well as some smaller private residences. In general, Singaporeans staying in larger properties with AV above the cut-off tend to have greater access to household wealth, and therefore would not be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. What address is used to determine the Annual Value in Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) assessment?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value will be based on the address reflected in your NRIC. Under the National Registration Act, you must report a change of address within 28 days of moving at any police station, or the Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA).<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q6. I disagree with my Annual Value assessment. What do I need to do to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
You may approach the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for a re-assessment. If the Annual Value of your property is subsequently re-assessed and meets the housing criterion, you may then appeal for Workfare Income Supplement.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q7. I am renting a room/whole unit in the property that I stay in. Am I eligible for Workfare Income supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
If you are renting the entire property unit, the annual value of that property unit will be used to assess your eligibility.<br><br>
If you are renting only a room or some rooms in the property, please write to us with your tenancy agreement and particulars (name, NRIC, telephone number, address and the nature of your appeal) on the online enquiry page:

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q9. What constitutes a second property for Workfare Income Supplement Scheme?</b></font></summary>
All types of properties e.g. Housing &amp; Development Board flat, private property and non-residential property, are taken into account in determining the eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.<br><br></details>
</details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Why is my spouse's income and property ownership used to determine my eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
To ensure that Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is targeted at recipients with limited access to household wealth, you will not qualify for WIS if :
<ul>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">the assessable income of your spouse for the preceding Year of Assessment exceeds $70,000; or</li>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px">you and your spouse together own two or more properties.</li></ul></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why is my spouse's Assessable Income for the preceding Year of Assessment used to determine my Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility for the current work year?</b></font></summary>
This is to allow potential Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) recipients to receive WIS earlier despite the time needed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for the processing and transmission of Assessable Income (AI) to the CPF Board.<br><br>
The AI for the previous Year of Assessment (YOA) is used to assess one's WIS eligibility for the current year. E.g. we will use your spouse's AI for YOA 2021 to assess your eligibility for 2022 WIS.<br><br></details>

	background: #4F4F4F;"><font size="+1.5" color="#FFF"><b>Payment and Notification</b></font></summary>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Why does the majority of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payment take the form of CPF top-ups?
</b></font></summary>
Other than providing a cash supplement to help lower wage workers cope with their daily needs, it is also important to help them build up their CPF savings for their healthcare and retirement needs.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. I have reached my Basic Healthcare Sum. What happens to the portion of the Workfare Income Supplement payment going into the MediSave Account?</b></font></summary>
Any MediSave contributions above the Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) will be transferred to your CPF Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA), which have interest rates equal or higher than that of the MediSave Account. The BHS cap and overflow arrangement are intentionally planned to avoid over saving in the MediSave Account and to supplement your retirement savings.<br><br>
These overflows which end up in your SA or RA can be withdrawn according to the usual withdrawal guidelines. For members who have met the Full Retirement Sum in their SA or RA, the savings in excess of the BHS will be transferred to the Ordinary Account (OA). Savings in the OA can be used for other purposes such as housing repayment.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. How can I update my bank account for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
You may <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/App/Home/Index?returnUrl=/paymentinstructions/edit">update</a> your bank account details for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) with your Singpass.<br><br>
However, please note that if you have a PayNow NRIC-linked bank account, it will be the default mode of payment. You will still receive your payout via PayNow NRIC, even if you change to another bank account on the Workfare Portal.<br><br>
	If you have linked your NRIC number to your bank account after the 16<sup>th</sup> of the month, or submitted your bank account details after the 14<sup>th</sup> of the month, your updates will only be effective in the following month.
<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. How will I receive the Workfare Income Supplement payment?</b></font></summary>
From March 2022, the cash portion of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will be credited to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account if you have one.<br><br>
Otherwise, it will be credited to the DBS/POSB, OCBC or UOB bank account that you have registered to receive Government payouts (e.g. either the GST-Voucher (GSTV), Silver Support Scheme (SSS) or WIS, whichever is latest) or credited to GovCash if you had not registered a bank account with us.<br><br>

We can only credit your Workfare payout to you via your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account. NRIC is an unchanged proxy issued by the Government, compared to mobile numbers which may be easily changed. To ensure that the money is credited to the correct recipientโs bank account, only NRIC will be accepted as the proxy for government payouts via PayNow.<br><br>
Eligible citizens who have linked their NRIC to their bank account will receive the payment in this bank account.<br><br></details>

GovCash is a new and more convenient way for citizens to receive their payouts from Government agencies.<br><br>
The Board will progressively replace cheques with GovCash from November 2021.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q18. How can I utilise my GovCash?</b></font></summary>
You can withdraw your payouts in cash at the listed OCBC ATMs with GovCash functions with your 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN), which will be sent to you by SMS or by post. You do not need to have a OCBC bank account to use this service.<br><br>
You can also transfer your payouts to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or utilise them to make payments at any merchants or transfer to your friends by scanning their PayNow QR code using the LifeSG mobile app. You can download the LifeSG mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q22. What should I do if I do not want to receive my payouts via GovCash?</b></font></summary>
You can choose to receive your payouts via Direct Bank Crediting.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q23. Why can withdrawals be made only in $10 denominations and what can I do with my balance GovCash?</b></font></summary>
Currently, the minimum withdrawal amount at the ATMs is $10. Hence, GovCash withdrawals can also be made in $10 denominations. If the balance in your GovCash is less than $10, you can accumulate your balance monies before your next withdrawal.<br><br>
Alternatively, you can also transfer the balance to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account or utilise them to make payments at any merchants or transfer to your friends by scanning the PayNow QR code using the LifeSG mobile app. You may refer to the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Documents/Leaflet_GovCash.pdf">step-by-step guide</a> for detailed instructions.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q24. Would I need to login to Singpass each time I open the LifeSG mobile app to access my GovCash?</b></font></summary>
No, you are only required to log in using SingPass when you first use the LifeSG mobile application. Subsequent use of the LifeSG mobile app do not require SingPass logins again, unless you have not used LifeSG mobile app for more than a year or deleted the application and re-downloaded it.<br><br></details>
