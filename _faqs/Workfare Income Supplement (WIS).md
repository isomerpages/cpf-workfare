The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. I am earning close to $2,300, why are my Workfare Income Supplement payouts so low?</b></font></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more.<br><br>
To best support lower wage workers, the WIS benefits are gradually reduced as the income levels of the workers increase nearer to the qualifying amount of $2,300. The gradual reduction ensures that the lower-wage workers do not see a sharp reduction in their WIS benefits when they upgrade their skills and begin to earn more. Taken together, the total amount of the income and the WIS payouts would still increase overall as one's income increases<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. I am earning $50 or less per month. What do I need to do to receive the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
You will be eligible for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if you meet all the other eligibility criteria and make voluntary CPF contributions for the monthly wages (where CPF contribution is exempted).<br><br>
The voluntary CPF contribution amount varies, depending on one's age and the prevailing CPF contribution rates. Please <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/FeedbackSubscription/Index" class="hyperlink">write to us</a> with your particulars and supporting documents (i.e. payslips/employer's letter) so we can advise you on the amount to contribute:<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. I am a contract / part-time employee. Will I be eligible for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
Contract / part-time employees are eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if they meet the WIS eligibility criteria.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. I am on no-pay/study/medical/maternity leave. Will I be considered as employed to qualify for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
For the purposes of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS), staff on study/medical/maternity leave will be considered as employees if you are still receiving a salary and CPF contributions from your employers.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q6. Of the Workfare Income Supplement payment to my CPF, what is the proportion credited into the various CPF accounts?</b></font></summary>
Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is paid partially in cash to help you with your immediate expenditure, and partially into your CPF accounts to boost your retirement adequacy. Up to age 55, a higher proportion is credited into your Special and MediSave Accounts to boost your retirement and healthcare savings respectively. After age 55, similar to employees, the majority of the contributions will go towards MediSave, with smaller proportions going towards the other two accounts.<br><br>
You can refer to the table below on the proportion of the WIS CPF payout credited into the three accounts, according to the age bands.<br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q7. How is my income calculated for the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
We will calculate your income based on the CPF contributions made by your employer(s) for work done in that month.<br><br></details></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Why do Self-Employed Persons receive only two-thirds of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) received by employees?</b></font></summary>
The CPF contribution made by Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) is comparatively lesser than employees who earn the same amount. SEPs are only required to contribute to their MediSave Account whereas employees need to contribute to all their CPF Accounts (Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts)<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why do employees receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments while Self-Employed Persons receive their WIS once a year?</b></font></summary>
The incomes of employees are automatically computed based on their monthly CPF contributions from their employers. This enables CPF Board to assess their Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility automatically and disburse their WIS payouts on a monthly basis.<br><br>
On the other hand, the net trade income (NTI) of a Self-Employed Person (SEP) is assessed over an entire year and can only be determined the following year after the current year has ended.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. Who is a Self-Employed person (SEP)?</b></font></summary>
A Self-Employed Person (SEP) is any individual who derives income from Singapore or from outside Singapore through any trade, business, profession or vocation excluding employment under a contract of service.<br><br>
If you earn an income by buying and selling goods or providing professional or personal services, you are a SEP. Examples of Self-Employed Persons include hawkers, taxi drivers, freelancers, sole proprietors or a partner in a partnership.<br><br>
Visit the <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Businesses/Self-Employed/Learning-the-basics/Am-I-an-Employee-or-a-Self-Employed/" class="hyperlink">Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website</a> to read more on the definition of a SEP.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Why must Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) contribute to MediSave to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
A key principle of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is that each recipient has a personal responsibility to save for his future needs, with the Government providing additional support.<br><br>
Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as they do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers. It is important to contribute regularly to ensure enough savings for healthcare needs. This is especially important during old age, when SEPs may have stopped working.<br><br>
WIS is intended to supplement, not replace the MediSave contributions made by the SEPs.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. What are the payment modes for making MediSave contributions?</b></font></summary>
There are several ways you can make your MediSave contributions.<br><br>
The most convenient way is via GIRO, which allows automatic monthly deductions from your bank account. You may apply to pay via GIRO online (if you have a bank account from OCBS/DBS/POSB) or by mail (for other banks).<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q7. I am a homemaker/caregiver/babysitter. Can I qualify for the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</b></font></summary>
The objective of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is to supplement the retirement savings and incomes of older and lower-wage Singaporeans, and to encourage them to work regularly.<br><br>
A person may be eligible for WIS if he is engaged in work that draws an income.<br><br>
Allowances received for carrying out family support roles such as babysitting and caregiving for dependents are considered transfers within the family. They are not external sources of income derived from employment, hence it would not be appropriate to consider these transfers for WIS.<br><br>
The Government recognizes that such family roles are important. There are other forms of government support for these roles, such as the Marriage and Parenthood package which provides broad-based support for couples to raise and care for their children.<br><br></details>

You will also need to meet the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme eligibility criteria in order to qualify for WIS.<br><br>
To conduct a home business, you need to follow the guidelines under HDB's Home-Based Small-Scale Business Scheme.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. I worked as both an employee as well as a Self-Employed Person in the work year. When will I receive my Workfare Income Supplement for the work year?</b></font></summary>
You will receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments based on your employee income if you meet the WIS eligibility criteria for the work year (WY).<br><br>
If you are also an eligible dual status worker (DSW) who has worked concurrently as a SEP and employee in the year, you may receive additional WIS if your combined employment and net trade income results in a higher WIS payout. You will receive your WIS top-up after you have declared your income (to IRAS or CPFB) and have made the required MediSave contributions.<br><br>
You will receive the WIS top-up once a year for work done as a Self-Employed Person in the preceding year. The earliest payment for SEPs/DSWs for a particular WY will be on 30 April WY+1. If you have declared your income and made your MediSave contribution by the last Friday of March WY+1, you would receive your WIS payout in end April WY+1*.<br><br>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. To qualify for Workfare Income Supplement, what is considered income?</b></font></summary>
Employee income is based on the definition of Gross Wages under the CPF Act:<br><br>
Total Gross Wages = Total Ordinary Wages + Total Additional Wages<br><br>
Where:<br>
Ordinary Wages are wages due or granted wholly and exclusively in respect of an employee's employment in that month and payable before the due date for payment of CPF contributions for that month.<br><br>
Additional Wages are wages which are not granted wholly and exclusively for that month. Examples are annual bonus, leave pay and other payments made at intervals of more than a month.<br><br>
Total Wages are the total amount of an employee's wages for any calendar month, which is the sum of his Ordinary Wages for the month and the Additional Wages paid to him in that month.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why are overtime pay and bonuses included in Workfare Income Supplement assessment?</b></font></summary>
Basic salary, overtime pay, and bonuses are part of a worker’s total income that will help support the worker and his or her family. Given that the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) is intended to supplement the income of lower wage workers, it is most useful to assess the total income in determining one’s eligibility for WIS.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. How does the income criteron work?</b></font></summary>
To receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) for work done in any month, employees must have earned:<br><br>
<ol>
	<li style="font-size:15.5px"> a gross monthly income of not more than $2,300 in that particular month; and</li>
<li style="font-size:15.5px"> an average gross monthly income of not more than $2,300 in the past 12 months.</li></ol><br><br>
</details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. Why am I not eligible for Workfare Income Supplement or Workfare Special Payment despite my gross monthly income being less than $2,000 (for WY2019) or $2,300 (for WY2020) as an employee?</b></font></summary>
Gross monthly income includes salary (before deduction of CPF contribution), bonuses, allowances and overtime pay received during the work period.<br><br>
Other than gross monthly income, you must also earn an average gross monthly income of not more than $2,300 (or $2,000 for Work Year 2019) in the past 12 months.<br><br>
The average gross monthly income is defined as:<br><br>
Sum of income earned in the past 12-month period ÷ Total number of months worked in the past 12-month period<br><br></details></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Do residents in welfare homes qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
Residents in welfare homes registered with the National Council of Social Service/ Ministry of Health/ Ministry of Social and Family Development will qualify for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) if they meet all of the other WIS eligibility criteria.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. Why is the Annual Value of my place of residence used to assess my eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value (AV) serves as a housing criterion that targets lower-wage workers from lower income households.<br><br>
Using AV instead of housing type is a fairer way to determine property value as some applicants may be staying in smaller and less expensive private properties with an AV similar to a larger Housing & Development Board flat.<br><br>
</details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. What is the Annual Value of a property?</b></font></summary>
Annual Value (AV) is the estimated gross annual rent of the property if it were to be rented out, excluding furniture, furnishings and maintenance fees. It is determined based on estimated market rentals of similar or comparable properties. It can be found on the property tax bill you receive each year.<br><br>
For more information on the computation of AV, please visit the <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Property/Property-owners/Learning-the-basics/About-Annual-Value/">Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) website</a>.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. How is the Annual Value (AV) requirement for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) decided?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value (AV) threshold of $13,000 covers all HDB flats, as well as some smaller private residences. In general, Singaporeans staying in larger properties with AV above the cut-off tend to have greater access to household wealth, and therefore would not be eligible for the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q5. What address is used to determine the Annual Value in Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) assessment?</b></font></summary>
The Annual Value will be based on the address reflected in your NRIC. Under the National Registration Act, you must report a change of address within 28 days of moving at any police station, or the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA).<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q6. I disagree with my Annual Value assessment. What do I need to do to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
You may approach the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for a re-assessment. If the Annual Value of your property is subsequently re-assessed and meets the housing criterion, you may then appeal for Workfare Income Supplement.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q7. I am renting a room/whole unit in the property that I stay in. Am I eligible for Workfare Income supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
If you are renting the entire property unit, the annual value of that property unit will be used to assess your eligibility.<br><br>

This is to allow potential Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) recipients to receive WIS earlier despite the time needed by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) for the processing and transmission of Assessable Income (AI) to the CPF Board.<br><br>
The AI for the previous Year of Assessment (YOA) is used to assess one's WIS eligibility for the current year. E.g. we will use your spouse's AI for YOA 2017 to assess your eligibility for 2018 WIS.<br><br></details>

<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q1. Why does the majority of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payment take the form of CPF top-ups?
</b></font></summary>
Other than providing a cash supplement to help lower wage workers cope with their daily needs, it is also important to help them build up their CPF savings for their healthcare and retirement needs.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q2. I have reached my Basic Healthcare Sum. What happens to the portion of the Workfare Income Supplement payment going into the MediSave Account?</b></font></summary>
Any MediSave contributions above the Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) will be transferred to your CPF Special Account (SA) or Retirement Account (RA), which have interest rates equal or higher than that of the MediSave Account. The BHS cap and overflow arrangement are intentionally planned to avoid over saving in the MediSave Account and to supplement your retirement savings.<br><br>
These overflows which end up in your SA or RA can be withdrawn according to the usual withdrawal guidelines. For members who have met the Full Retirement Sum in their SA or RA, the savings in excess of the BHS will be transferred to the Ordinary Account (OA). Savings in the OA can be used for other purposes such as housing repayment.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q3. How can I update my bank account for Workfare Income Supplement?</b></font></summary>
You may <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/App/Home/Index?returnUrl=/paymentinstructions/edit">update</a> your bank account details for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) with your Singpass.<br><br>
For bank account details that are submitted after 14th of the month, it will take effect in the following month.<br><br></details>
<details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Q4. How will I receive the Workfare Income Supplement payment?</b></font></summary>
The cash portion of Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will be credited to your bank account that was registered to receive Government payouts (e.g. either the GST-Voucher (GSTV), Silver Support Scheme (SSS) or WIS, whichever is latest) or sent to you via cheque if you do not have a bank account. Compared to cheque payments, electronic payments make transactions simple, swift, and safe for recipients. We strongly encourage you to update* your bank account to receive your future Workfare payouts earlier.<br><br>
* bank account details submitted after 14th of the month will be effective in the following month.<br><br>
You will be notified of your payment details via letters and/or SMS messages before the payment dates. You can <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/App/Home/Index?returnUrl=/wisnotices/index">retrieve a copy of your notification letters</a> by logging in to e-Services at Workfare Portal with your Singpass. To receive earlier notifications, you may update your Singpass-registered mobile number to receive the payment details via SMS messages at <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/App/Home/Index?returnUrl=/people/notificationmode">"View/Update My Notification Mode"</a>. <br><br></details>
