The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details>

		<font color="#FFF"><b>Q4. What do I need to do to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
If you are an employee, you do not need to do anything. Your eligibility for Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) will be automatically assessed based on the CPF contributions* made by your employer. <br><br>
If you are a Self-Employed Person (SEP), you need to declare your net trade income (NTI) and contribute to your MediSave Account to be considered for WIS. Use our <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.workfare.gov.sg/Pages/Calculator.aspx">online WIS calculator</a> to find out the amount you need to contribute to your MediSave Account.<br><br>
You can declare your income and contribute to your MediSave Account in various ways.<br><br>
To receive your WIS payouts by 30 April (via bank crediting), please declare your NTI and contribute to your MediSave Account by the last Friday of March.<br><br>
*Under the CPF Act, employers must contribute to CPF if their employees earn more than $50 a month, regardless of whether the employee is employed on a permanent, part-time, contract or casual basis. If your employer is not contributing CPF on your behalf, you can lodge a report on non/underpayment of CPF contributions online. Please log in to my cpf with your Singpass, then select My Request > Other CPF Matters > Report on non-payment or underpayment of CPF contributions.<br><br>
