		<summary>Q1. What is the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details>
