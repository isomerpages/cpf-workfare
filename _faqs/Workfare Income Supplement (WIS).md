		<summary><b><font color="#009427">What are the enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme?</font></b></summary>The Government will enhance Workfare from Work Year 2023:<ol class="loweralph">
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Qualifying monthly income cap raised from $2,300 to $2,500</b><sup>1</sup>. This takes into account income growth of Singaporeans.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Extension of Workfare to those aged 30 - 34</b>. The payouts will help them better cope with their expenses and to start saving early for their retirement.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Higher annual Workfare payouts of up to $4,200</b>. Payouts depend on age and income, and have been enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees can receive up to $4,200 per year in payouts, compared to $4,000 per year today. Older workers will continue to receive the highest payouts. The payouts for self-employed persons are set at two-thirds of employee payouts and will be correspondingly increased.</li>
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>All persons with disabilities (PWDs) will qualify for the highest Workfare payout tier (up to $4,200), regardless of age.</b></li>

<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b><font color="#009427">Why will Workfare enhancements only take place in 2023?</font></b></summary>
Implementing the Workfare enhancements in 2023 provides sufficient time to make the required system changes, for smooth implementation of the enhancements.<br><br>
The current Workfare criteria, which only came into effect two years ago in 2020, will continue to apply for work done in 2022.<br><br></details></li>
<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><b><font color="#009427">What is the Workfare Income Supplement scheme?</font></b></summary>
The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details></li>
