		<summary><b><font color="#009427">What are the enhancements to the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme?</font></b></summary>The Government will enhance Workfare from Work Year 2023:<ol class="loweraplh">
<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Qualifying monthly income cap raised from $2,300 to $2,500</b><sup>1</sup>. This takes into account income growth of Singaporeans.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom: 2px; font-size:15.5px"><b>Higher annual Workfare payouts of up to $4,200</b>. Payouts depend on age and income, and have been enhanced across all age bands. Eligible employees can receive up to $4,200 per year in payouts, compared to $4,000 per year today. Older workers will continue to receive the highest payouts. The payouts for self-employed persons are set at two-thirds of employee payouts and will be correspondingly increased.</li>

The Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme was introduced in 2007 as a permanent feature of Singapore's social security system. The support is targeted at older, lower wage Singaporean workers whose earnings are in the bottom 20% of the working population, with support also available for those earning slightly more. Eligible workers will receive support via cash and CPF top-ups to supplement their income and retirement savings.<br><br></details></li>

To best support lower wage workers, the WIS benefits are gradually reduced as the income levels of the workers increase nearer to the qualifying amount of $2,300. The gradual reduction ensures that the lower-wage workers do not see a sharp reduction in their WIS benefits when they upgrade their skills and begin to earn more. Taken together, the total amount of the income and the WIS payouts would still increase overall as one's income increases.<br><br>
From Work Year 2023, the qualifying income cap will be raised to $2500.

If you earn an income by buying and selling goods or providing professional or personal services, you are a SEP. Examples of Self-Employed Persons include hawkers, taxi drivers, freelancers, sole proprietors or a partner in a partnership.<br><br>

SEPs are only required to contribute to their MediSave Account whereas employees need to contribute to all their CPF Accounts (Ordinary, Special and MediSave Accounts).<br><br></details></li>
				<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Why do employees receive monthly Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) payments while Self-Employed Persons receive their WIS once a year?</b></font></summary>The incomes of employees are automatically computed based on their monthly CPF contributions from their employers. This enables CPF Board to assess their Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) eligibility automatically and disburse their WIS payouts on a monthly basis.<br><br>
On the other hand, the net trade income (NTI) of a Self-Employed Person (SEP) is assessed over an entire year and can only be determined the following year after the current year has ended.<br><br></details></li>
				<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>Why must Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) contribute to MediSave to receive Workfare Income Supplement (WIS)?</b></font></summary>
A key principle of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is that each recipient has a personal responsibility to save for his future needs, with the Government providing additional support.<br><br>
Self-Employed Persons (SEPs) are required to contribute to their MediSave Accounts as they do not receive regular MediSave contributions from employers. It is important to contribute regularly to ensure enough savings for healthcare needs. This is especially important during old age, when SEPs may have stopped working.<br><br>
WIS is intended to supplement, not replace the MediSave contributions made by the SEPs.<br><br></details></li>
				<li class="Numbering" style="font-size:17px"><details><summary><font color="#009427"><b>What are the payment modes for making MediSave contributions?</b></font></summary>
There are several ways you can make your MediSave contributions.<br><br>
The most convenient way is via GIRO, which allows automatic monthly deductions from your bank account. You may apply to pay via GIRO online (if you have a bank account from OCBC/DBS/POSB) or by mail (for other banks).<br><br>

The objective of the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme is to supplement the retirement savings and incomes of older and lower-wage Singaporeans, and to encourage them to work regularly.<br><br>
A person may be eligible for WIS if he is engaged in work that draws an income.<br><br>
Allowances received for carrying out family support roles such as babysitting and caregiving for dependents are considered transfers within the family. They are not external sources of income derived from employment, hence it would not be appropriate to consider these transfers for WIS.<br><br>
